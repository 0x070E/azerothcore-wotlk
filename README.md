## Introduction

AzerothCore is an open source game-server application for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 3.3.5a game version.

It is written in C++ and based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.

## Why AzerothCore?

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience. In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**.

Like MaNGOS and TrinityCore did in past, we like to write clean code and doing software development right, but **our main goal is to have fully working features**. In other terms, we always prefer proper solutions to problems, but we may accept "*hackfixes*" (when they do not affect the game stability) if a proper solution is not available yet.

We also believe in [software modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), because the more the software is modular, and the more it will be easy to be maintained, understood, developed, etc...

## Work in progress...

The project is still undert a work in progress phase, so all guidelines may not be available yet, but feel free to starting contributing. We will love to review and accept your PRs.
